Homework Instructions
date: 2024-01-05

You have 10 questions to answer. These are listed in the pdf file `problem_set_1.pdf`

Each question has an associated file. For example, the answers to question 2 will be 
in file `question2.py`. This file has one function per subquestion, in this case
the functions `question2_1` through `question_2_5`. 

The homework will be graded automatically when it is submitted. For each question, 
the structure of your answer is first checked, and you have the opportunity to fix it. 
For example, if the answer takes the form of a dictionary, the structure of the dictionary
is checked, such as variable types, options chosen, etc. You can submit the homework for grading 
as many times as you wish to fix as many structural errors as possible. 

In the final submission, the answers will be evaluated for correctness, and these answers
will determine your grade. Different questions have different number of points associated
with them, which are listed in the pdf file. 

I am sure that there will be errors of various kinds, which are to be reported to the TA, 
who will handle these edge cases. 

In later homeworks, there might be less structural checks, which will require you to carefully 
read the homework, since the chance for needless errors will increase. 

NOTE: there is no Question 1.
